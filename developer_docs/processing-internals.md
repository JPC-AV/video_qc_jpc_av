## Frame Analysis (`checks/frame_analysis.py`)

Unified module controlled by `FrameAnalysisConfig`. Three optional sub-steps, each independently togglable:

- **Border detection**: Detects active video area and head-switching artifacts. Modes: `simple` (fixed pixel crop, default 25px) or `sophisticated` (edge detection). Supports auto-retry with refinement iterations.
- **BRNG analysis**: Detects out-of-range luma/chroma values using multi-method voting; generates diagnostic thumbnails and an HTML report with magenta highlights.
- **Signalstats**: FFmpeg `signalstats` filter analysis over selected time periods (default: 3 periods of 60s each).

Color bars end time (from qct-parse) is passed to frame analysis so non-program content is skipped. Results feed into the HTML report.

Frame analysis image/JSON outputs (`_enhanced_frame_analysis.json`, `_border_detection.jpg`, `brng_thumbnails/`) are written to **`{video_id}_qc_metadata/`**, not `report_csvs/` — `analyze_frame_quality(output_dir=destination_directory)` and `destination_directory` is the qc_metadata dir (see `dir_setup.py`). Some frame-analysis CSV sidecars and HTML fragments do go to `report_csvs/`.

## qct-parse Subsystem (`checks/qct_parse.py`)

`qct_parse.py` is the largest single module in the codebase (~3000 lines). It is **not** just a "tool check" — it is its own subsystem that walks the QCTools sidecar (`.qctools.xml.gz` / `.qctools.mkv`) once and runs several optional analyses against it. All sub-features are controlled by flags on `QCTParseToolConfig`. Entry point: `run_qctparse(video_path, qctools_output_path, report_directory, …)`. The module derives from the open-source [qct-parse](https://github.com/FutureDays/qct-parse) project; substantial pieces have been rewritten or added on top.

Sub-features (each independently togglable):

- **Color bars detection** (`barsDetection`): `detectBars()` walks the report looking for SMPTE color bars at the head, writes start/end timestamps to `qct-parse_colorbars_durations.csv`. The end time is downstream-consumed by frame analysis and access-file generation so bars are skipped.
- **Color bars evaluation** (`evaluateBars`): `evalBars()` reads parsed bar values out of the QCTools report and compares them to expected SMPTE color values (`maxBarsDict`); mismatches are written to `qct-parse_colorbars_values.csv`.
- **Threshold-based tag checks** (`analyzeIt()`): for each profile tag in `SpexConfig.qct_parse_values`, count frames where the value exceeds/under-runs the threshold. Mismatches are summarized in `qct-parse_failures.csv` and `qct-parse_summary.csv`.
- **Thumbnail export** (`thumbExport`): `printThumb()` writes a JPEG snapshot when a threshold is crossed (rate-limited via `thumbDelay`/`thumbExportDelay`). Saved under `ThumbExports/` in the report directory; `find_qct_thumbs()` in the report generator surfaces them.
- **Audio analysis** (`audio_analysis`): `analyzeAudio()` runs four independent detectors over a single pass of the QCTools tags. Each writes its own CSV/summary and HTML report subsection:
    - **Clipping** — flags frames where `Peak_level ≥ AUDIO_CLIPPING_THRESHOLD_DB` (default −0.5 dBFS).
    - **Channel imbalance** — compares per-channel `RMS_level` and flags sustained level differences across channels.
    - **Audible timecode (LTC)** — detects LTC bleed-through. Uses **two layers**: R128 mix-loudness gates (`r128.M`, `r128.M_mean`, `r128.M_stdev`, `r128.LRA`) for "stable mix at TC level", plus per-channel `astats` gates (`Crest_factor`, `Zero_crossings_rate`, `RMS_level`, `Entropy`) for the per-channel split. Thresholds are calibrated against three known-TC samples and two non-TC negatives; constants live at the top of the audio section in `qct_parse.py:1057–1119`. The `astats` layer runs in two stages: a coarse 30s rolling-window pass (`_detect_astats_channel_tc`) finds TC *territory* but its stdev stability gate is poisoned by brief dropouts (a ~3s real gap reads as a ~100s hole), so `_tc_refine_astats_gaps()` then re-scans each region per frame — a frame is TC only if all four metrics sit in their bands (`_tc_frame_in_band`), and a region is split only on a *sustained* non-TC run (`_TC_GAP_MIN_SEC`, default 2s, after merging runs separated by a sub-second TC flicker). This reclaims TC the window dropped around a brief interruption and pins gap boundaries to the frame. The two layers fire redundantly over the same TC, so their overlapping detections are collapsed into **consensus regions** by `_tc_build_consensus()` — conceptually the qct-parse/CLAMS color-bars consensus, but **astats is privileged for segmentation**: the per-channel astats boundaries are authoritative (astats resolves true breaks where the carrier stutters or one channel drops out, which the mix-based R128 meter smooths over), and R128 is demoted to corroboration — it only adds the `R128` method label where it overlaps an astats region. A standalone R128 span (no astats overlap) is kept **only when the report has no per-channel astats data** (older QCTools reports); when astats data is present, an uncorroborated R128 detection is discarded as a false positive — the R128 loudness gates alone can't tell LTC from other steady-loudness audio (heavily compressed music passes criterion A; quiet speech over a near-silent channel passes criterion C — both confirmed false-positive regimes, in sample files JPC_AV_03796/03801 and LC 21459403/21462335 respectively), and "Audible Timecode Detected" follows the consensus regions, not the raw per-method list. `qct-parse_audible_timecode.csv` leads with the consensus table (last column *Detection Methods*) and keeps the raw per-method detections in a trailing *Per-Method Detections* section; the HTML report shows only the consensus regions. Region **Start/End are written as the file's own timecode** — NDF `HH:MM:SS:FF` or DF `HH:MM:SS;FF` (`_tc_format_timecode`) — so positions match an NLE; the *Duration* column stays elapsed `M:SS.s`. Frame rate comes from `_get_video_frame_rate` (default NTSC 29.97); the **start-timecode offset and drop-frame flag are read from the stream's TIMECODE tag** via `_get_video_start_timecode` + `_tc_parse_start_timecode` (`;` before frames ⇒ drop-frame), threaded `run_qctparse → analyzeAudio → _detect_and_write_timecode_results`. QCTools timestamps are real wall-clock seconds, which read ~0.1% (~3.6s/hour) *ahead* of the NDF timecode an NLE shows — converting to a frame index, adding the start-TC offset, and re-labelling in the file's convention removes that apparent drift. DF math (`_tc_df_to_frames`/`_tc_frames_to_df`) drops 2 frame-numbers/minute except every 10th (4 at 60 fps).
    - **Audio dropout** — flags sudden RMS drops indicative of tape dropout. Uses a **rolling median baseline** of RMS / max-RMS-diff / zero-crossings-rate, then flags single-frame deviations against thresholds (`DROPOUT_RMS_DROP_THRESHOLD_DB`, `DROPOUT_DIFF_DROP_FACTOR`, `DROPOUT_ZCR_SPIKE_FACTOR`). Candidates are merged into events.
- **Clamped-levels detection** (`detect_clamped_levels`): finds runs of frames whose luma is clamped to broadcast range (16–235 in 8-bit / 64–940 in 10-bit). Outputs a graph and summary if hits are found.
- **Chroma phase error detection** (`detect_chroma_phase_errors`): `analyzeChromaPhaseErrors()` detects sudden cyan/magenta colour shifts typical of helical-scan tracking failures on tape sources. Two-rule detector per frame:
    1. **Envelope-wide (primary):** within a single frame, both U and V span nearly the full chroma range (`UMIN < CHROMA_ENVELOPE_LOW` AND `UMAX > CHROMA_ENVELOPE_HIGH` AND same for V).
    2. **SATMAX high (secondary):** catches partial-frame events where only part of the frame is in error.
  Thresholds are defined for 10-bit (0–1023) and scaled /4 for 8-bit. Consecutive flagged frames within `CHROMA_EVENT_GAP_FRAMES` are merged into a single event; events shorter than `CHROMA_MIN_EVENT_FRAMES` are suppressed as false-positive transients. Up to `CHROMA_MAX_THUMBS` event thumbnails are written to `ChromaPhaseThumbs/` (kept separate from `ThumbExports/` so the generic thumb finder doesn't pick them up). Sidecar CSVs: `qct-parse_chroma_phase_summary.csv`, `qct-parse_chroma_phase_events.csv`. GUI checkbox lives on the Complex tab; CLI flag is `--enable-chroma-phase-detection`.

### qct-parse gotchas

- **`detectBars()` threshold rationale**: `YMAX_thresh` / `YMIN_thresh` / `YDIF_thresh` detect luma characteristics of SMPTE bars. `SATMAX_thresh` is the key discriminator — it distinguishes real color bars (high saturation) from static or near-black frames that happen to meet the luma criteria. `bars_confirmation_threshold` (30 frames ≈ 1s at 30fps) prevents false starts from analog artifacts. The `relaxed=True` flag halves confirmation, lowers SATMAX by 60%, and doubles YDIF tolerance — use it for CLAMS-guided retries where bars existence is already probable.
- **`make_color_bars_graphs()` implicit contract**: depends on three inputs that must describe the same bars region: the duration CSV (for the timestamp annotation), the values CSV (for the bar chart data), and the thumbnails dict (for the first-frame image). Passing mismatched inputs (e.g., head-bars duration CSV with a windowed-bars values CSV) silently produces wrong output. Use `duration_override`, `bars_label`, and `thumb_profile_filter` parameters to control which data each graph shows.
- **`print_color_bar_values()` CSV column naming**: the detected-bars column header is `{video_id} Colorbars` (hardcoded in `qct_parse.py`). Code that reads this CSV (e.g., `make_color_bars_graphs`) must use this exact pattern to look up the column.
- **Reporting a media time *position* to the user — use the file's timecode, not wall-clock seconds.** QCTools `pkt_pts/pkt_dts` values are real elapsed seconds. An NLE (DaVinci Resolve, etc.) shows the file's embedded timecode, which for NTSC NDF runs ~0.1% (~3.6 s/hour, ~2 s at 36 min) *behind* wall time, plus any start-TC offset. Printing raw seconds therefore looks "ahead of the NLE, growing with runtime" — this is *not* a bug, it's the format mismatch. The audible-timecode path does it correctly: `_tc_format_timecode(seconds, fps, start_frames, drop_frame)` converts to a frame index, applies the start-TC offset, and re-labels NDF (`HH:MM:SS:FF`) or DF (`HH:MM:SS;FF`); inputs come from `_get_video_frame_rate` + `_get_video_start_timecode` + `_tc_parse_start_timecode`. **`dts2ts()` (used by color bars, audio dropout, chroma-phase events, thumbnails) still emits raw `HH:MM:SS.ssss` wall-clock seconds and has this drift** — anything new that surfaces a position to the user should prefer the `_tc_format_timecode` path. Durations/intervals can stay elapsed seconds (the drift on a short span is negligible and a duration isn't a timecode position).

## CLAMS Detection (`checks/bars_detection_clams.py`, `checks/tone_detection_clams.py`)

Sits parallel to the qct-parse color-bars/tone analysis but is independent (separate `clams_detection: ClamsDetectionConfig` field; toggled via `--enable-clams-detection`). Two scripts:

- **`bars_detection_clams.py`**: SSIM-based color bars detection against a bundled reference fingerprint. Tunables in `ClamsBarsParams`: `threshold` (SSIM), `sample_ratio`, `stop_at_frame`, `min_frame_count`, `stop_after_one`, `merge_gap_seconds`. Output: `clams_bars_durations.csv`. **SSIM is computed by a local `structural_similarity()` (scipy.ndimage-based) at the top of this module — NOT scikit-image. It is a verified bit-identical reimplementation of skimage's default 2D path; do not re-add the `scikit-image` dependency.**
- **`tone_detection_clams.py`**: cross-correlation tone detection over the audio waveform (loaded mono @ 16 kHz). Tunables in `ClamsToneParams`: `tolerance`, `min_tone_duration_ms`, `stop_at_seconds`, `merge_gap_seconds`. Output: `clams_tone_durations.csv`.

The numeric tuning fields above are **CLI-unsettable** — `update_tool_setting()` only accepts `clams_detection.run_tool`. Tune them in the JSON config or via the GUI.

### Combined bars/tone detection pipeline ordering

CLAMS detection runs before qct-parse in `process_qctools_output()`. CLAMS tone detection runs first (whole file, fast), then CLAMS bars detection (beginning + tone-flagged regions), then cross-validation second passes. The combined CLAMS regions are passed to `run_qctparse()` via the `clams_regions` parameter. qct-parse runs its own head bars detection, then windowed scans on CLAMS regions not covered by the head bars. If a windowed scan fails at normal thresholds, it retries with `relaxed=True`. The authoritative `color_bars_end_time` for downstream uses "longest/latest wins" across both detectors for head bars only; mid-file bars are report-only.

## QCTools Report Discovery

`find_qctools_report()` in `processing_mgmt.py` searches both `{video_id}_qc_metadata/` and `{video_id}_vrecord_metadata/` before generating a new report. If an existing report is found, it is used and the run-tool step is skipped.
